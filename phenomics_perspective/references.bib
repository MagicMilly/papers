The main gateway to this resource is through TAIR’s homepage http://www.arabidopsis.org. It is a repository of large amounts of data including gene, mapping, protein, expression and community data in the form of a relational database. These data can be searched, downloaded and analysed using the tools provided. Here, the simple search (for retrieval of information), SeqViewer (for the visualization of the five Arabidopsis chromosomes and associated annotations) and AraCyc (database of Arabidopsis biochemical pathways, with a graphical overview onto which large data sets, such as gene expression data, can be overlaid) tools are described with examples.},
